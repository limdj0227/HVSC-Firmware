/**
  System Interrupts Generated Driver File 

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    interrupt_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the generated driver implementation file for setting up the
    interrupts using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for MPLAB(c) Code Configurator interrupts.
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - pic24-dspic-pic32mm : v1.26
        Device            :  dsPIC33EV256GM002
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 1.30
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.45
